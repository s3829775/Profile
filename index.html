                Hi, I am Liam, I have been programming for over 8 years. I am half Australia, Half Canadian.

            <h4>What is your interest in IT?</h4>
            <p class="lead">
                I started my interest in IT since I was younger. I have been programming since 2012 when I got into
                Minecraft Modding. I got into modding after playing Minecraft with friends and saw what big servers and
                modpacks had and were doing. I really wanted to do what other people were doing so I taught myself Java
                and learnt to make mods, I started out with a very basic mod based off a tutorial that acted like a
                grenade item, and from there taught myself more complex stuff and have contributed to many other mods. I
                have been working on commission mods for the past year on and off. I am currently working with friends
                on trying to make a startup that hosts Minecraft mods and other game mods.

                I chose to come to RMIT after trying to find a university that works for, I have done previous study at
                different universities but never could stay motivated. I was diagnosed with ADHD after I started uni and
                since then I have found it a lot easier to stay motivated and I have been studying at RMIT for over a
                year now.

                The results reflect most of what I am feeling and believe about myself. I will probably take a less

                part of the team but be someone who completes the work assigned to me. These tests should be used to try
                and get
                different opinions and understanding into a team. Having completely different opinions and ideas if you
                can
                discuss things correctly can help to complete projects.

                The job is a fullstack JavaScript developer and is mainly Node.js based. The job is developing software
                around game server hosting but there is a lot of side projects that Nodecraft staff develop. The job
                appeals to me as I have a partnership with Nodecraft for projects I have worked on, and I believe the
                culture around the company is great. I have some experience with some of the requirements but I don’t
                believe I would qualify to work there as I don’t have enough.

                For me to learn these skills, it would be beneficial to implement them into one of my existing projects,
                or a project in the future. A lot of these technologies aren’t complex but learning them and being
                familiar enough to be proficient with them takes time.

            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p class="lead">
                A program that connects to third party keyboard/mouse/streamdeck and other third-party devices to
                create a way to attach macros to it. For example, having a keyboard with macro keys that can be used
                type a phrase in for you, or to open a web browser to a specific tab.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="mr-auto">
            <h4>Motivation</h4>
            <p class="lead">
                A lot of manufacturers have their own macro software, this would give a central place to create
                macros for your hardware and helps to remove limitation on what the manufactures software can do.
                You can make it interact with something for example an API directly and do something in response, or
                you could make it change OBS scenes.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class=mr-auto">
            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p class="lead">
                The goal of the software is the interact with third party hardware to do what you want in a
                programable way that is easy to use for users. I also want to be able to setup my own virtual stream
                deck that can be used on another device or mobile and would allow for clicking buttons on the screen
                to interact with the computer. The software helps to solve the gap and limitations of existing
                software being designed for specific hardware by the manufactures as well as the limited actions you
                can do by using these software’s. Existing software out there you are very limited on what the macro
                can do, such as it can type out a phrase you want or connected actions to programs such as Discord.
                For most users this might be the limit to what they need, but for users who want to use their
                hardware to the fullest it would be useful to implement a way to extend off this and implement a
                range of different things such as opening websites, fetching the latest weather and reading it out
                to you, or other actions.
                Elgato Stream Decks are very useful, and they cover a lot of the required I want to develop, but the
                software is limited to their own hardware. I want to extend from the Stream deck and implement new
                actions and hardware that isn’t covered by the device. This could be to add new actions to a MIDI device
                like a launch pad, or even physical racing pedal that users try to use and innovate using.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class=mr-auto">
            <h4>Tools and Technologies</h4>
            <p class="lead">
                You would need to have a physical device such as a keyboard/mouse/streamdeck. USB intercept software
                such as USBPCap/Wireshark.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class=mr-auto">
            <h4>Skills Required</h4>
            <p class="lead">
                I would need to learn about human interface devices as well as understand OBS websockets and
                communication between the software and a mobile app/website. I need to be able to understand the
                communication that is being done between the software that is currently in place for devices such as
                Logitech G Hub and the hardware. As well as implementing the device and sending the required bytes to
                the device to set it up and use it. I have previously written basic code to interact with a Logitech
                G105 keyboard, but it was based on existing code so I would need to implement this device in my own
                software and have it able to do what I require.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class=mr-auto">
            <h4>Outcome</h4>
            <p class="lead">
                The project will help to fill a void in cross hardware support and limitation of current software that
                interacts with the hardware. It would be opensource and built in a modular way so that you can easily
                add new devices or connections and thirdparty developers can interact with it too. It would help a lot
                of streamers or other users who want to use their devices to the fullest.
